	abstract = {We consider the parameterized problem, whether for a given set D of n disks (of bounded radius ratio) in the Euclidean plane there exists a set of k non-intersecting disks. For this problem, we expose an algorithm running in time nO(k ) that is—to our knowledge—the first algorithm with running time bounded by an exponential with a sublinear exponent. For λ-precision disk graphs of bounded radius ratio, we show that the problem is fixed parameter tractable with a running time 2O(k )+nO(1). The results are based on problem kernelization and a new “geometric (· -separator) theorem” which holds for all disk graphs of bounded radius ratio. The presented algorithm then performs, in a first step, a “geometric problem kernelization” and, in a second step, uses divide-and-conquer based on our new “geometric separator theorem.”},

Its expected running time on a concurrent-read concurrent-write PRAM with O({\textbar}E{\textbar}dmax) processors is O(log n), where dmax denotes the maximum degree. On an exclusive-read exclusive-write PRAM with O({\textbar}E{\textbar}) processors the algorithm runs in O(log2n). Previously, an O(log4n) deterministic algorithm was given by Karp and Wigderson for the EREW-PRAM model. This was recently (independently of our work) improved to O(log2n) by M. Luby. In both cases randomized algorithms depending on pairwise independent choices were turned into deterministic algorithms. We comment on how randomized combinatorial algorithms whose analysis only depends on d-wise rather than fully independent random choices (for some constant d) can be converted into deterministic algorithms. We apply a technique due to A. Joffe (1974) and obtain deterministic construction in fast parallel time of various combinatorial objects whose existence follows from probabilistic arguments.},

Here \${\textbackslash}norm\{.\}\$ may be any norm on \${\textbackslash}eR{\textasciicircum}d\$, and \${\textbackslash}nu\$ may be any probability distribution on \${\textbackslash}eR{\textasciicircum}d\$ with a bounded density function. We consider the chromatic number \${\textbackslash}chi(G\_n)\$ of \$G\_n\$ and its relation to the clique number \${\textbackslash}omega(G\_n)\$ as \$n {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$. Both McDiarmid and Penrose considered the range of \$r\$ when \$r {\textbackslash}ll ({\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}ln n\}\{n\}){\textasciicircum}\{1/d\}\$ and the range when \$r {\textbackslash}gg ({\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}ln n\}\{n\}){\textasciicircum}\{1/d\}\$, and their results showed a dramatic difference between these two cases.

Both McDiarmid and Penrose asked for the behaviour of the chromatic number in this range. We determine constants \$c(t)\$ such that \${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}chi(G\_n)\}\{nr{\textasciicircum}d\}{\textbackslash}to c(t)\$ almost surely. Further, we find a "sharp threshold" (except for less interesting choices of the norm when the unit ball tiles \$d\$-space): there is a constant \$t\_0{\textgreater}0\$ such that if \$t {\textbackslash}leq t\_0\$ then \${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}chi(G\_n)\}\{{\textbackslash}omega(G\_n)\}\$ tends to 1 almost surely, but if \$t {\textgreater} t\_0\$ then \${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}chi(G\_n)\}\{{\textbackslash}omega(G\_n)\}\$ tends to a limit \${\textgreater}1\$ almost surely.},

We present approximation algorithms for computing a maximum independent set of intersection graphs of convex objects in R 2 . Specifically, given (i) a set of n line segments in the plane with maximum independent set of size α, we present algorithms that find an independent set of size at least ( α / ( 2 log ( 2 n / α ) ) ) 1 / 2 in time O ( n 3 ) and ( α / ( 2 log ( 2 n / α ) ) ) 1 / 4 in time O ( n 4 / 3 log c n ) , (ii) a set of n convex objects with maximum independent set of size α, we present an algorithm that finds an independent set of size at least ( α / ( 2 log ( 2 n / α ) ) ) 1 / 3 in time O ( n 3 + τ ( S ) ) , assuming that S can be preprocessed in time τ ( S ) to answer certain primitive operations on these convex sets, and (iii) a set of n rectangles with maximum independent set of size βn, for β ⩽ 1 , we present an algorithm that computes an independent set of size Ω ( β 2 n ) .

In this paper, we survey recognition-complexity results for disk intersection and contact graphs in the plane. In particular, we refer a classical result by Koebe about disk contact representations, and works of Breu and Kirkpatrick about bounded-ratio disk representations. We prove that the recognition of disk-intersection graphs (in the unbounded ratio case) is NP-hard. This result is proved in a more general setting of noncrossing arc-connected sets. We also show some partial results concerning recognition of ball intersection and contact graphs in higher dimensions. In particular, we prove that the recognition of unit-ball contact graphs is NP-hard in dimensions 3,4, and 8 (24).},

We then tackle max independent set. Following the bottom-up method we propagate improvements of worst-case complexity from graphs of average degree d to graphs of average degree greater than d. Indeed, using algorithms for max independent set in graphs of average degree 3, we tackle max independent set in graphs of average degree 4, 5 and 6. Then, we combine the bottom-up technique with measure and conquer techniques to get improved running times for graphs of maximum degree 4, 5 and 6 but also for general graphs. The best computation bounds obtained for max independent set are O *(1.1571 n ), O *(1.1918 n ) and O *(1.2071 n ), for graphs of maximum (or more generally average) degree 4, 5 and 6 respectively, and O *(1.2127 n ) for general graphs.

	abstract = {For more than 40 years, Branch \& Reduce exponential-time backtracking algorithms have been among the most common tools used for finding exact solutions of NP-hard problems. Despite that, the way to analyze such recursive algorithms is still far from producing tight worst-case running time bounds. Motivated by this, we use an approach, that we call “Measure \& Conquer”, as an attempt to step beyond such limitations. The approach is based on the careful design of a nonstandard measure of the subproblem size; this measure is then used to lower bound the progress made by the algorithm at each branching step. The idea is that a smarter measure may capture behaviors of the algorithm that a standard measure might not be able to exploit, and hence lead to a significantly better worst-case time analysis. In order to show the potentialities of Measure \& Conquer, we consider two well-studied NP-hard problems: minimum dominating set and maximum independent set. For the first problem, we consider the current best algorithm, and prove (thanks to a better measure) a much tighter running time bound for it. For the second problem, we describe a new, simple algorithm, and show that its running time is competitive with the current best time bounds, achieved with far more complicated algorithms (and standard analysis). Our examples show that a good choice of the measure, made in the very first stages of exact algorithms design, can have a tremendous impact on the running time bounds achievable.},
