# Ringsizes tables:
These tables correspond mostly to the "ringsizes" pgsql tables (see q_run_all for exact copy statement). 

Additionally, a newfirst and last row should added with values copied from the previous 1st/last row, but all values of `ring\d+` should be 0. 

More permanent solution would be nice though currently no idea how to do it.
