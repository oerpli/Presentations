	abstract = {One might think that, once we know something is computable, how efficiently it can be computed is a practical question with little further philosophical importance. In this essay, I offer a detailed case that one would be wrong. In particular, I argue that computational complexity theory---the field that studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve computational problems---leads to new perspectives on the nature of mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of logical omniscience, Hume's problem of induction, Goodman's grue riddle, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, closed timelike curves, and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis.},

	abstract = {A mathematical problem is computable if it can be solved inprinciple by a computing device. Some common synonyms for“computable” are “solvable”,“decidable”, and “recursive”. Hilbert believedthat all mathematical problems were solvable, but in the 1930’sGödel, Turing, and Church showed that this is not the case. Thereis an extensive study and classification of which mathematicalproblems are computable and which are not. In addition, there is anextensive classification of computable problems into computationalcomplexity classes according to how much computation—as afunction of the size of the problem instance—is needed toanswer that instance. It is striking how clearly, elegantly, andprecisely these classifications have been drawn.},
