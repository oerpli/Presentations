	abstract = {Efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning a graph into connected components, biconnected components and simple paths. The algorithm for partitioning of a graph into simple paths of iterative and each iteration produces a new path between two vertices already on paths. (The start vertex can be specified dynamically.) If V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max (V, E) when executed on a random access computer.},

	abstract = {In the Block Graph Deletion problem, we are given a graph G on n vertices and a positive integer k, and the objective is to check whether it is possible to delete at most k vertices from G to make it a block graph, i.e., a graph in which each block is a clique. In this paper, we obtain a kernel with O(k6)O(k6)\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}(k{\textasciicircum}\{6\}) vertices for the Block Graph Deletion problem. This is a first step to investigate polynomial kernels for deletion problems into non-trivial classes of graphs of bounded rank-width, but unbounded tree-width. Our result also implies that Chordal Vertex Deletion admits a polynomial-size kernel on diamond-free graphs. For the kernelization and its analysis, we introduce the notion of ‘complete degree’ of a vertex. We believe that the underlying idea can be potentially applied to other problems. We also prove that the Block Graph Deletion problem can be solved in time 10k⋅nO(1)10k⋅nO(1)10{\textasciicircum}\{k\}{\textbackslash}cdot n{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}(1)\}.},
