# Company induced systemic risk in the Austrian economy

These slidesets accompanied a very condensed talk about my Master's Thesis. Slides are available in English and German (I wasn't sure in which language the presentation would be held).

PDF versions are provided because the slides cannot be compiled from the sources as some of the plots use csv files that also contain sensitive data.
