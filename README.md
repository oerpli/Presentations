# [Presentations](https://github.com/oerpli/Presentations/)

Slides for presentations I've held during my studies (**Ph**ysics and **C**omputer **S**cience). Some of the earlier presentations don't cite sources correctly I think. Consider this if you want to use them for whatever purposes you have in mind. Plagiarizing would also be be unscholarly.

## List

Presentations I consider more interesting are bold (ymmv).

## Getting started

Each folder contains at least one `.tex` file. Compile it to get the PDF. Some presentations have additional material (report papers, handouts, ...), this should be self-explanatory. 
The `Systemic Risk` presentation cannot be compiled as some plots are based on data files with somewhat sensitive data. Compiled PDFs (EN and DE) are in the folder. [Contact me](http://twitter.com/oerpli) if you have a question or something.
